Getting started
---------------

Updating requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Project uses `pip-tools
<https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`_ for requirements management. If you need to add a new requirement, go to
``requirements`` directory and change the corresponding \*.in file. After that call ``make update_requirements`` to
compile \*.txt files and synchronize local environment.

For requirements installation in CI or production environments it is enough to simply call ``pip install -r
requirements/<file_name>.txt``.

For compatibility with traditional project structure there is also ``requirements.txt`` file at project root, which
simply links to ``requirements/production.txt``.

Tests
^^^^^

Project uses ``pytest`` for testing.

All tests should be placed inside ``tests/`` directory and (ideally) follow the project structure - for example, tests
for ``{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}.some_package.some_module`` should be located at
``tests/some_package/test_some_module.py``

To run tests: ``make test``.
To run tests and receive a coverage statistics: ``make coverage``.
